# BSM-Monte-Carlo-and-Real-Time-Options-Pricing
Comparision of BSM, Monte Carlo simulations and Real Time Options pricing
- The dynamic data feeds provides a realistic approach to options pricing in various market conditions
- The Black schole's model built uses real-time values of volatility, risk-free interest rates, and time to maturity
- By running numerous simulations, this tool provides a range of possible option prices, allowing for a more accurate estimation of an option's fair value
